In this period of quarantine due to the coronavirus, many companies have suggested to their employees to start working from home, when this working regime is possible. But as quiet and convenient as it may seem to work from the comfort of your home, you need to get organized to make the most of the day.

## 1. Organize your schedule

&nbsp;

To work from home you need to have discipline and organization, especially now that the kids are at home too. You need to organize the times and activities of the day so that work gets to you and you don&#8217;t end up with a headache. See what you can do to ensure efficient work days.

If you need to divide your time between routine home care, children, parents and other people living in the same environment, the first step is to organize your schedule of commitments.

For those who are not used to working from home, it can be very difficult to separate activities and end up working almost nothing because you got up from your chair to pay attention to other activities.

Therefore, the advice is to find the quietest hours to work, even if that means starting earlier or later than usual, when the children are or have already gone to bed.

## 2. Prepare the right environment

Depending on the type of work you do, it will not be possible to sit in the living room, with the children around you and with the TV on. So, while an adult in the family pays attention to the little ones, organize a reserved space in another room to do your work with maximum silence and concentration. In this way, you will also be able to get free more quickly.

## 3. Communicate with your team

Working remotely can be a challenge for anyone who is used to talking in person with co-workers every day. So be prepared to communicate with everyone through e-mails, WhatsApp, and internal company platforms, and let everyone know what your routine schedule will be so you don&#8217;t delay your answers and business activities.

## 4. Making Video Calls

For those who need to have constant meetings with the team, video calls are essential. In meetings, it is important to keep looking at colleagues to better understand what is going on and see their expressions, especially when dealing with clients. Try out Skype, WhatsApp or other means of calling, and arrange times when you won&#8217;t be interrupted.

## 5. Try to maintain a normal routine

While there is this extraordinary need to be home with family during work hours, do your best to maintain a normal routine. Change your clothes, produce at the usual times, keep the team informed at the beginning and end of the day about the activities carried out, and take time off for snacks and meals.

## 6. Put more practicality into the routine

If you used to have the habit of eating in a restaurant and without your children, you know that now there is no way to do it. So, at mealtime it tends to be much more problematic. To make it easier, prepare the meal ahead of time and leave most of the housework as early as possible so that it doesn&#8217;t interfere with your work routine.

## 7. Be patient with yourself and others

The adaptation may take a little while, but you must respect your time, without neglecting your health. Eat well, sleep well and keep everyone informed about how this phase has gone, listening also to the needs and difficulties of your companions.
