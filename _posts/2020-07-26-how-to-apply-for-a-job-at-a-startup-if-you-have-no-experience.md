Be aware that if you are going to look for a job it is very possible that you will be asked for experience, but if you don&#8217;t have it you should make yourself aware that it is not impossible to get a job, if you really think about whether you have opportunities at hand.

## Take advantage of your qualities

Take some time to reflect on your innate skills or those you have developed throughout your academic life, for example: teamwork, initiative, interest in learning, your behaviour in the face of challenges, perseverance in achieving your goals, etc. It will be very valuable to you when you go for a job interview.

## Apply for your CV

The job board at your university or education institutions such as Platzi/employment that is heavily used by industry recruiters and in which you not only validate your knowledge but also strengthen it.

## Take advantage of social networks

Prepare and communicate your profile in social networks and aggregations of the technology sector. Remember that there are portals where you can host and share your projects, e.g. GitHub. This is perhaps one of the most important points since here you can show your skills in code and development that you can do on your own initiative using the languages that you master the most.

## Networking

Attending forums, events and networking helps you to share with people who have the same interests as you and through whom you can also make yourself known, it is a very important time to share knowledge.

## You can start by doing freelance work

Looking for freelance jobs is a very practical way to approach solutions to real world problems. In this way you will be building your own experience, facing challenges and getting to talk properly about a project.

## Your Portfolio

It is your real letter of introduction as a professional, it is where you will leave evidence of your work, your developments, projects, articles of your authorship, it is not necessary that you do so extensive, but make sure it shows your strengths and skills.
