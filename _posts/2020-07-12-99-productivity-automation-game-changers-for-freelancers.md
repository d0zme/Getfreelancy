Being a 100% independent freelancer requires you to always be at the top of your game to rake in clients. And in my opinion, a solo operation requires a plethora of automation.

But automation doesn’t happen on its own.

The same business can become a 60 hour a week job, or it can be a 10 hour a week asset. The difference is in the automation system built around it – a system that’s made up of apps, software and human resources.

So in order to help other nomads see just what’s possible when it comes to automation, I’ve compiled this list of 99 resources that you can use to help build and maintain a location independent income with less effort and more output.

### Marketing Automation {.western}

**1 – Leadpages** – quickly and easily create landing pages from pre-existing, conversion tested templates. Ideal for setting up opt-in pages, sales pages, upsells, thank you pages, etc.

Pricing: from $25/mo to $199/mo if you pay annually ($37/mo to $79/mo paid monthly)

**2 – Infusionsoft** – a comprehensive all-in-one suite of tools covering lead capture, conversion analytics, e-commerce, time management and email marketing.

Pricing: from $199/mo to $599/mo

**3 – Aweber** – low cost, reliable email marketing software (meaning it has one of the highest successful delivery rates.) Works well combined with Leadpages.

Pricing: starting from $19/mo (0 to 500 subscribers), 30 day free trial

**4 – Mailchimp** – alternative email marketing software that you can start with for free if you’re on a super tight budget.

Pricing: free up to 2000 subscribers, paid plans start at $10/month

**5 – GetResponse** – email marketing platform, with slightly lower starting costs for a larger list compared to Aweber.

Pricing: starting from $15/mo for up to 1000 subscribers

**6 – Unbounce** – landing page builder, similar to Leadpages.

Pricing: from $49/mo to $499/mo, free 30 day trial

**7 – Pardot** (from Salesforce) – Salesforce offers a range of marketing automation products. Pardot is specifically designed for business-to-business automation and is relevant for nomads running client service agencies -it’s outside the price range and beyond the needs of most freelancer and solo entrepreneurs.

Pricing: $1000/mo to $3000/mo

**8 – Clickfunnels** – simple sales funnel creation tool. Includes landing page creation, site hosting, split testing and email autoresponders in one place.

Pricing: Marketing software starts from $200/mo. CRM is free and sales software starts from $0/mo.

**10 – OptimizePress** – landing page builder, similar to Leadpages and Unbounce. The main difference is that OptimizePress has a one-time fee so it’s cheaper over the long run (although you can pay a monthly fee to access more templates). I have tested it out and ended up going back to Leadpages for convenience.

Pricing: $97 to $207, one time fee (monthly fee for extra templates)
