The coronavirus pandemic is dragging on, and Google Meet is going to extend free unlimited calling until March 2021.

Google&#8217;s plans with its Google Meet application include placing a 60-minute limit on video calls for the free service. This practice is common in this type of tools that place a limit on connections, time or functions for occasional users and a paid service for professionals.

But with the pandemic and the quarantine, the companies&#8217; plans changed and they decided to delay their paid services, or to make some of the functions free, to help in the communication between people, and in the meantime to serve as promotion of their services.

From Google, the tool was made available to anyone with a Gmail account and the free premium features until September 30th. But shortly before the end of the promotion, they decided to extend it until March 2021.

If you are away from your friends, family or co-workers, this is no excuse for not communicating with them. Here are five applications that let you make group video calls to keep talking to those people.

We don&#8217;t know if the offer will definitely expire on March 31st, but a similar campaign is welcome at a time when Google wants to &#8220;continue helping those who trust Meet to stay in touch,&#8221; according to the company&#8217;s statement at Engadget.

Furthermore, this will also allow communications between families to be facilitated during a Christmas period when trips and mass meals are expected to be reduced for obvious reasons. This may make it foreseeable that, even as the pandemic improves, video calls will multiply again by the end of the year.

In any case, the implementation of new features will continue in Google Meet over the coming months and will continue in this obvious competition between different companies to achieve the application of hegemonic video calling, a tool that is more than necessary for these times and that has contenders as different as Zoom, Skype or WhatsApp. At the moment, with campaigns like Google Meet, it is the users who are winning.
