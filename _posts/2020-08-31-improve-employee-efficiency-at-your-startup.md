  * Be mindful of employees&#8217; health. Try to mitigate the monotonous and repetitive nature. In addition to alternating the shifts gradually so that it does not alter the health rhythm of employees.
  * Night shift. There are likely local laws regarding night shifts, so look into them and be reasonable. It isn’t healhy for someone to be on this shift forever, so keep in mind the human aspect when people work overnight.
