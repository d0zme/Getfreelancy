Years after the acquisition of Screenhero, [Slack has been offering screen sharing functionality on video calls to paying account users](https://slack.com/help/categories/200111606-Using-Slack#make-calls-share-your-screen), making it an alternative to Zoom for work collaboration. This does not mean that all those who want to use the third party solutions cannot use them. On the contrary, they will still be available to anyone who wants to make use of them.

Regarding the new feature, which will be expanded in the coming days to the latest versions of Slack for Windows and Mac, Slack points out that it will be accessible from any channel or direct message from which a call with Slack is initiated through a new button. It clarifies that those users who are going to share screen and have several monitors, will be able to select the screen to share.

When a screen is being shared, Slack will temporarily disable the video feed from the webcam itself and will also mute notifications, so that screen sharing attendees will only see what is being shared, including the computer cursor, nothing else. Once screen sharing is complete, everything will return to normal.

Hopefully, the launch of this feature will not take away the developers&#8217; interest in keeping their solutions integrated into the platform, since all the solutions could coexist to make it easier for users to choose the option that best suits the needs of their teams.
