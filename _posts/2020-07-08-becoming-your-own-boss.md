From the beginning and throughout our lives, we have been convinced to live within a pilot plan that was also instilled in our parents and grandparents, without most people stopping to analyze if it was the right one for everyone. However, for many people being Freelancer could be the best way forward.

As we grew up, it was a fact that we had to study for that college degree that was so precious to society, and then aspire to a high position within some recognized company. Later, we had to buy a house, a car, and then get married and have children (all in that order).

But many of us realized that it didn&#8217;t have to be that way, since human beings don&#8217;t have the same priorities. There are different ideas, dreams, goals and desires and we came to the conclusion that spending 8 hours a day stuck inside an office working for someone else, was not for us.

Then, the thought of getting freedom and independence started to go around in several heads and having control of what to do, when to do it (and on top of that, getting a good income from it), for many is the dream job.

## WHAT IS A FREELANCER?

A FreeLancer is nothing more than someone who makes a living independently, offering their professional services without fixed schedules and in an autonomous manner.

## WHY BE A FREELANCER?

Throughout life we develop different tastes, ideas and skills and probably many of us studied for years to specialize in an area that we thought would give us a good monetary return.

Then it turned out that during the search for a job that would allow us to bring the knowledge and skills we had acquired, there were not enough places on the market, or the companies offering the vacancies did not pay enough, or when we managed to get the much desired position, we simply realized that it was not what we wanted to do.

Many of us have faced this reality: some do not get a &#8220;good&#8221; job and others, we decided to leave the one we had because the traditional vacancies can become very demanding. And we decided to go it alone and on our own terms.

In the United States alone, more than 54 million people have chosen to give up their jobs to become independent and earn a better income, in addition to the long-awaited flexibility in time and schedules.

## ADVANTAGES OF WORKING AS A FREELANCER

You have many advantages if you&#8217;re a Freelancer, and here are some:

Job Opportunities: Working as a Freelancer is not only convenient for the Freelancer, but also for those companies that require very specific jobs at a certain time, but cannot (or do not need) to have someone full time to do them.

Therefore, hiring a Freelancer gives them the opportunity to work with professionals who have skills and abilities in different areas, without having to incur recurring monthly expenses. And that translates into more jobs for those offering services independently.

Schedule: I would dare say that is one of the main reasons to work as a Freelancer (at least for me). One of the most tedious things in life is having to spend more than 8 hours a day sitting in an office doing the same thing and watching life pass before your eyes, don&#8217;t you think?

Being FreeLancer gives you the opportunity to own your time and decide which and how many hours you are going to work and even better, the ability to take care of your personal things without having to ask anyone&#8217;s permission.

You will be able to take care of your family in case of emergency, do all the personal errands you need and rest when you need to, without having problems with your superiors or even losing your job.

Generate Additional Income: Another of the frustrating things about working for someone else is finishing all your daily duties and having to spend the rest of the hours in front of a desk doing nothing, in order to comply with the established schedule.

However, if you are self-employed, you will have the opportunity to make money in more than one thing and/or in more than one company. Providing your services simultaneously to several clients will make you generate more income in the same period of time (that, of course, depends on your organization and productivity).

Lifestyle: And probably the most important thing is that, when you are independent, you can simply live. How many of us didn&#8217;t miss out on important things in our lives, because we were subject to a plant job? Who couldn&#8217;t go on a trip because at the last minute they didn&#8217;t get their vacation approved? How many couldn&#8217;t attend their children&#8217;s ballet performance or soccer game, because it conflicted with their working hours?

And there are many other advantages of working independently that you will get to know along the way, if you decide to embark on a life of freedom and happiness.

## DISADVANTAGES OF FREELANCING

Like everything else in life, working as a Freelancer can also have some disadvantages:

Starting from scratch, without a fixed salary: When we start out as freelancers, it&#8217;s very normal that it takes us some time to generate an income and perhaps that&#8217;s the biggest fear of those who are interested in entrepreneurship. Like everything else, being Freelancer is a process and it can take time to see results (in some cases more and in others less).

Ups and downs: This happens in any business (your own or not) and there will be good times and bad times as a result of your own decisions or because of situations that are out of your control.

The difference is that when it is our own business, it is our responsibility to look for new options to improve the situation.

However, it is this type of situation that keeps us on our toes, looking for opportunities to improve and trying to grow more and more. There is nothing that can&#8217;t be solved if we keep a positive attitude and are willing to give everything to move forward with our venture.

As we enter this new world, we are going to encounter obstacles and probably at some moments we will feel that they surpass us. But it is precisely there when we must remember the reasons why we decided to choose this path, and think about all the advantages and benefits that it brings us.

## SERVICES YOU CAN OFFER AS A FREELANCER

We can really offer any kind of service as Freelancer, as long as it is directed independently to companies or individuals. Among the most common are:

  * Certified Public Accountant
  * Writer or Content Editor
  * Administrative Assistant
  * Digital Marketing Specialist
  * Public Relations
  * Community Manager
  * Web Designer

## HOW TO WORK AS A FREELANCER

If you are going to work independently, the first thing you need to be clear about is your skills. Ask yourself what you can offer and from there, you will know the best path to take.

The most sensible thing to do (and most choose to do) is to offer those services that you already have work experience in and have worked on for some time and know well.

Once you have selected the services you will offer to companies and potential clients, it is time to put together your business plan. This will ensure that you get off on the right foot and avoid wasting time and money making rash decisions in unexpected situations.

It is also very important to be clear about what the laws of the country in which you plan to practice require, because in many places you may need some kind of permit or license (among other legal documents), to provide your services either as a company or as a natural person.

Once you put together your business plan and get the legal stuff in order, it&#8217;s time to start promoting yourself effectively to attract clients:

Create a Web Page: A website will not only allow you to offer all the information about your services to your clients and maintain a sample catalog about your work, but those who seek your services will also feel more confident, since it will give your business a professional look.

Additionally, with your website you can earn money online in different ways, and get extra passive income.

Create Social Networks for your Business: The Digital Era also took over the business world and now it is mandatory to promote yourself through Social Networks, because a company that does not do so, runs the risk of becoming invisible.

This is the fastest and most feasible way to promote yourself and make yourself known, and one of the great advantages that Social Networks offer us is the ease with which information reaches all levels. Additionally, they are very easy to use and largely free.

As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, it is also possible to earn money through them and here I explain how to earn money with Instagram.  
Contact methods: You also need to have a good contact method to receive or send information to your customers, which you can do by using a professional email or a phone number to share from your website.

Wherever you go and whatever you do, always look for opportunities to improve. It is vital to identify your niche customers and know where the companies or people who may require your services are located.

Depending on the market or the niche you have chosen to practice, it is a good idea to look for information on guilds or associations that are dedicated to the same and register. This will give you credibility, influence, prestige and positioning.

The time has come to be brave, to make an effort and never give up, if you want to be the absolute master of your time. Being a Freelancer is not an easy road, but if you put everything into it I can assure you that it will also be full of satisfaction and every achievement (and even every fall) will be a nice story to tell.

Live by informing yourself and never stop learning, because knowledge is power. And later on, when you look back and see all the way you have gone, you will know that each of those moments was worth it. Absolutely all of them.
