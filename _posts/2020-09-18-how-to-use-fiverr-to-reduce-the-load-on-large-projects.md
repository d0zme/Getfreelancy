Fiverr has a bad reputation &#8211; especially coming from freelancers. This platform has had a negative association with this group because they feel the pressure to create services that start at $5. To be sure, a lot has changed since the initial creation of this market &#8211; including the need to have a price that starts at $5.

Even if you are not looking for help as a business, you can use Fiverr to get some interesting and even a little strange services, just for fun. Like Groupon, the platform is a search engine for things you probably didn&#8217;t know you wanted. This can be a double-edged sword, because you could get addicted to shopping!

I have used Fiverr for many years, both as a seller and more recently as a buyer. I have made over $10,000 on the platform and have reinvested thousands of dollars buying Fiverr services from freelancers in your market.

In both situations, I have created win-win situations for myself, people who buy my services, and those I buy from. CodeinWP shares their own list of tips for buying Fiverr services, but I say there is much more to say.

Let&#8217;s start this discussion on how to use Fiverr against the current possibly misperception you have of it.

## The Advantages of Using Fiverr

First and foremost, it is not mandatory to offer services from $5 in Fiverr. For freelancers, this means that you don&#8217;t have to break your services into small pieces to make it worth your while &#8211; you can create packages worth hundreds of dollars (or more!).

In an effort to attract more expert freelancers to the platform, Fiverr recently announced a new version of its market: Fiverr Pro. Unlike the Fiverr vendors in the main version of the marketplace, the vendors in Fiverr Pro are individually vetted by Fiverr employees. The end result? Access based on demand with an impeccable reputation with brands you are likely to know.

And if you&#8217;re still not convinced that Fiverr cares about his freelancers, consider his latest acquisition of AND CO.

AND CO is an all-in-one business management tool for freelancers including functionality to create contracts, track time and manage expenses. Since Fiverr&#8217;s acquisition of AND CO, freelancers have unlimited free access to tools that were previously blocked by a monthly membership.

And you don&#8217;t even have to be a Fiverr seller (or buyer) to use these tools &#8211; they are free for everyone.

Yes, there are still Fiverr offers at the price of $5. Many of these low-cost jobs are attributed to sellers from other areas of the world, with much lower expenses.

You may have ethical reasons for outsourcing work, to the detriment of your own country&#8217;s prosperity. I see it as an opportunity to help people around the world by having equal access to employment. Some of my favorite Fiverr vendors talk about how important Fiverr is to them, because it gives them the money to put food on the table for their family &#8211; to me that&#8217;s worth a lot.

## What to outsource in Fiverr?

Now let&#8217;s talk about how to use Fiverr: an introduction to the economics of these jobs. The Fiverr market offers a wide variety of services, called &#8220;jobs&#8221;.

Jobs are usually single projects but the Fiverr system also offers functionality for multiple &#8220;milestone&#8221; deliveries. This means that a freelancer could effectively use Fiverr to create advance services, although this is not as common.

There are some jobs you can buy on Fiverr that are relatively bad for business, we will talk about that later.

On a more positive note, here are the larger categories that are usually a bargain at Fiverr:

  * Graphic Design (I work with a designer to make t-shirt designs for my ecommerce business).
  * Digital Marketing (I hired a Fiverr salesman to help me set up some advanced features in MailChimp)
  * Social Networking
  * Video Edition/Production
  * WordPress Works
  * Writing/Correction of Text
  * Data Entry
  * Minimalist logo design (there are some talented logo designers at Fiverr if one is looking well. Check out how Woorkup got an outsourced logo for their blog)

&nbsp;

## What Not to Outsource on Fiverr?

We have said it before, but it is better to repeat it: use Fiverr to outsource tasks, not strategies.

In addition to this advice, here are some recommendations for what not to outsource on Fiverr and categories of work to avoid completely:

**SEO tasks:** Unfortunately, when it comes to SEO, Fiverr does not have the best reputation. You will definitely want to avoid jobs that promise excellent first page positioning in Google or link building. In these situations, vendors justify their low prices with black hat tactics. These black hat tactics may work in the short term, but they will be very expensive along the way and it will be very annoying to try to fix them in the future. Buying SEO content is OK, just make sure they pass the Copyscape test before accepting the job.

**Buying followers on social networks:** Without counting Fiverr, buying followers is practically buying bots. Not only does this look very bad, as it is very easy for anyone to investigate your followers &#8211; it is also very likely a violation of the terms of service on the platform where you are using these followers. This could cause them to close your account!

(Probably) anything that only costs $5: Although there are still many jobs that start at $5, it&#8217;s fair to assume that this is an attempt by vendors to stay competitive. Even though people in low income countries may justify these prices, this creates a price war. Instead of encouraging ridiculously low prices, use your good money and buy the job that has a higher price.

Something you need for the next day: Unless you&#8217;re dealing with a super-responsive seller who offers fast delivery for an extra cost. If they don&#8217;t seem to have this process built in, they probably won&#8217;t deliver a quality job in such a short time.

**Non-native English text:** You&#8217;ll spend more time and money to make it sound good. It&#8217;s just not worth it.

To be fair, Fiverr makes changes to major job categories when necessary.

In 2017, they discontinued product testimonial videos and replaced it with the Video Spokesperson category. This was an effort to appease the FTC, an organization known for its lack of appreciation for undisclosed paid relationships between a brand and the person giving the testimony.

Of course, it can be said that Fiverr is not afraid to operate on the edge of what might be considered ethical, as they already do with some of the categories of work mentioned above (notably, SEO work and buying social network followers).
