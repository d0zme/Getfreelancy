To have a fluid communication and free of external noises. This is the goal of Microsoft Teams that is working on a new functionality based on artificial intelligence that will be able to cancel the noise between your communications.

At the moment, this noise-canceling function is in the testing phase but it is expected to be available to everyone from November, as it is currently under development in Microsoft 365 Roadmap, the company [explained in a statement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-365/roadmap?utm_source=gadgets360&utm_medium=gadgets360&utm_campaign=gadgets360&utm_term=gadgets360&filters=In%20development&searchterms=noise).

This new functionality will be able to analyze the user&#8217;s audio signal and using deep neural networks trained to do so, will filter the noise and only the voice signal will be retained.

However, users will have to activate this new functionality in settings, in the Stop option, in order to cancel the background noise in their communications.

Microsoft is also working on increasing the maximum number of members in an organization from 5,000 to 10,000, although the figure may be as high as 25,000 for individual teams.
