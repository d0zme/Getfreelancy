## Loan Origination Call Center Advantages

Call centers provide numerous advantages to existing, as well as prospective, customers of Lending Institutions.

Listed below are some of the more compelling advantages:

## 

## Convenience

Your customers can apply for a consumer loan at hours that are convenient for them, which are often not normal business hours.

## 

## Speed

Most credit applications can be credit decisioned while the customer is still on the phone. (Applications are underwritten to your credit criteria. We recommend that a combination of judgmental criteria and Credit Bureau Risk Score be utilized.)

## 

## Value

Your costs become variable if outsourced as opposed to fixed if performed &#8220;in-house&#8221;. In many cases, the cost of building a call center in-house can soon become prohibitive when considering the cost in hardware, software, facility, and people.

## 

## Competition

Your Company must be competitive in the marketplace. To accomplish this goal, you need to offer to your customers at least the same services they can obtain from the larger financial institutions; but at a cost that is affordable to your organization.

## 

## Branch Time

For Financial Institutions, a call center can actually create &#8220;branch time&#8221; by supplementing the traditional branch&#8217;s consumer loan sales process. In many instances, the peak volume periods in a call center are also the peak traffic hours in a branch. By offloading the consumer loan sales process to an outsource provider, the branch employees become more productive by being available to provide other services.
