As a freelancer, you have a wide variety of marketing options available to you. Just which ones will bring you the clients you prefer to work with depends — it’s important to make sure that the methods you use allow you to reach the places prospective clients will be.

It’s worth considering a wide variety of options. For that, it’s useful to have a list of options to consult:

  * Start a blog
  * Go to Chamber of Commerce events and other local business events
  * Release products (icons, articles, etc.) that can be used for free with attribution
  * Hand out business cards
  * Guest post on blogs relevant to your skills
  * Attend meetups in your area
  * Place your brochures with printers, or other relevant businesses
  * Organize a BarCamp or other unconference
  * Network online with sites like LinkedIn or Twitter
  * Share samples of your work online
  * Respond to press queries on Help A Reporter Out
  * Sponsor an event
  * Suggest a story to a reporter or blogger
  * Offer a coupon
  * Create a free ebook and post it online
  * Write a press release describing something special about your business
  * Offer to speak about your specialty at networking events
  * Answer questions on LinkedIn Answers, Yahoo Answers and other question sites
  * Comment on articles and posts
  * Create package deals
  * Develop a partnership with a freelancer with a different skillset
  * Send out a useful newsletter geared towards your clients
  * Provide a free initial consultation
  * Join a professional organization
  * Add yourself to directories, both online and in print
  * Place promotional items in event and conference gift bags
  * Run targeted adds
  * Volunteer your services to non-profits
  * Contact companies that could use your services directly
  * Attend alumni events for your school
  * Contact past clients
  * Attend events for your ideal clients’ industry
  * Join online forums
  * Print t-shirts listing your website
  * Have a giveaway or donate your time as a prize in someone else’s giveaway
  * Survey companies in your target market about their needs (and then follow up on those needs)
  * Optimize your website for search engines
  * Hand out brochures that showcase your projects
  * Get great testimonials from past clients
  * Teach a class
  * Brand yourself as a business
  * Start a podcast or videocast
  * Sell your services through affiliates
  * Work with an agency
  * Swap ads with other freelancers
  * Send out a postcard or other mailer
  * Package your promotional materials or services with other freelancers
  * Tell happy clients that you’ll give them a referral discount for any new clients they send your way
  * Celebrate the end of a large project with your client

Many of these options are inexpensive, though not all of them are free. That price tag makes it easier to experiment with your options — so do it! Take some time on a regular basis to try out different marketing techniques and see which ones will work for you — and which ones you can adapt. There are even more options out there than are listed here. If you have a marketing technique not listed here, please add it in the comments.
